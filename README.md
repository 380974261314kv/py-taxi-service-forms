# Taxi service forms

- Read [the guideline](https://github.com/mate-academy/py-task-guideline/blob/main/README.md) before start.
- Make sure that you change the settings for [html-files](https://github.com/mate-academy/py-task-guideline/blob/main/html_settings/README.MD).


In this task, you will implement a custom form and django built-in forms to create,
update or delete content from the site.

Since this task is the last step before deploying your project, 
there is no fixture attached to this task, we strongly recommend that you fill it out yourself.

1. Implement:
    - `Create`, `Update`, `Delete` views for `Car`, 
    - `Create`, `Update`, `Delete` views for `Manufacturer`.
2. On the car list page add button that leads to the car creation page. On the car 
detail page add buttons that lead to the car update page and car deletion page.
3. On the manufacturer list page, add the button that leads to the manufacturer creation
page. Also, add columns `Update`, `Delete`, and add links for the updating page and 
deletion page for each manufacturer.
4. Use crispy forms in your forms to make website more beautiful.

NOTE: Attach screenshots of all created or modified pages to pull request. It's important to attach images not links to them.
